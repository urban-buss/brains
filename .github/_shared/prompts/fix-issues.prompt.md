# Fix Issues

Work through all open issues in the `issues/` folder, fixing each one
systematically.

## 1. Discover

List all `.md` files in `issues/` (excluding `_resolved/`). If no issues
exist, report "No open issues" and stop.

## 2. Fix each issue

Iterate through every issue file. For each one, complete **all** sub-steps
before moving to the next.

### 2a. Understand

- Read the full issue document carefully.
- Identify the affected modules, reproduction steps, and expected behaviour.
- Check related source files and tests to build context.
- Consult `docs/` for architecture and data-model details if relevant.

### 2b. Plan

Before writing code, outline:

- Root-cause analysis.
- Which files will be created or modified.
- What tests are needed (regression test covering the issue + edge cases).
- Any documentation updates required.

Present the plan briefly, then proceed.

### 2c. Implement & test

- Apply the fix following project conventions (see `implement.prompt.md` and
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md`).
- Write or update tests in the matching `tests/test_<module>.py` file.
- Run the relevant tests to confirm the fix:

```
pytest tests/test_<module>.py -v
```

All targeted tests must pass before proceeding.

### 2d. Commit

Stage and commit the changes:

```
git add -A
git commit -m "fix(<scope>): <short description>" -m "<details of what was wrong and how it was fixed>"
```

### 2e. Resolve

Move the issue file to `issues/_resolved/`:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path issues/_resolved -Force
git mv issues/<filename>.md issues/_resolved/<filename>.md
```

Prepend `[RESOLVED] ` to the document's H1 title inside the file. Commit:

```
git add -A
git commit -m "docs: resolve issue <filename>"
```

### 2f. Next

Move to the next issue and repeat from 2a.

## 3. CI validation

Once all issues are resolved, run the full CI pipeline (see
`ci.prompt.md`):

```
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
pytest --collect-only -q
pytest --cov={{package_name}} --cov-report=term-missing
{{cli}} --help
```

All checks must pass.

## 4. Summary

Print a final report:

- Number of issues resolved.
- One-line summary per issue (filename → what was fixed).
- CI status (pass/fail).
- Any follow-up items or caveats.
